## 🎯 Mission

Building practical tools that enhance developer productivity and explore the intersection of terminal UIs, context-aware development, and AI-assisted workflows. We focus on:

- **Terminal-first experiences** - Rich, interactive applications that leverage modern terminal capabilities
- **Context awareness** - Tools that understand and adapt to development workflows
- **Developer productivity** - Utilities that streamline common tasks and reduce friction
- **Experimental prototypes** - Exploring new ideas at the intersection of classic computing and modern AI

### Legend

- ![Active](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-active-success) **Active** - Under active development or maintenance
- ![Production](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-production-blue) **Production** - Stable and production-ready
- ![Prototype](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-prototype-yellow) **Prototype** - Experimental, proof-of-concept stage

## 💻 Technology Stack

Projects across the organization use a variety of languages and tools:

- **C** - Low-level systems programming, terminal applications, games
- **Go** - CLI tools, utilities, performance-critical applications
- **Python** - Scripting, data analysis, rapid prototyping
- **Shell** - Build scripts, automation, environment setup

Common patterns:
- ANSI escape codes for terminal graphics and control
- Frame buffering for smooth animations
- Context-aware tooling and AI integration
- Cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, BSD)
